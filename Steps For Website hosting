Hi Everyone.

Lately I have been seeing posts of projects for portfolio on #CloudGuruChallenge ., initiated by Forrest Brazeal. Kudos to that.

So I made a pet project as well. Using the below:

1.Docker
2.ECS
3.ALB
4.ACM
5.CloudFront
6.Route53

Steps:
1. Bought a domain in Route 53. (Would be helpful for future use cases as well)
2. Created website using basic HTML. Created a Docker Image containing all the files for the website.
3. Uploaded the Docker Image to the Docker repository.
4. ECS on Fargate: Created Task Definition, with the Docker image in Container Definition, Set the port mappings.
5. Created ECS Cluster. Added Task Definition in the Cluster. Created Service for the cluster. 
6. Created ALB as frontend to the service in ECS Cluster(Did the changes in the Cluster as well).
7. Created CloudFront Distribution, as ALB as Origin.
8. Created an SSL Certificate for the domain, and updated the "Alternate Domain CNAME, and SSL Certificates for the CloudFront distribution.
9. Added Record in Route 53 to THE CloudFront Distribution.

And the result is https://animalsworld-ashishk.cloudblogs.de .

Alternatives:
1. As the website is static. I could have used S3 for hosting. But wanted to play around with ECS & ALB.
2. Using S3, Could have saved costs and is the recommended way to go fo this use case. 
3. Instead of Docker Repo, could have used the ECR service by AWS. (This way the whole outcome would be based outof AWS itself.

Future Cases:
Would love to make it all IAC using CloudFormation, that would be next.

Shoutouts:: Huge Thanks to Adrian Cantrill for awesome courses which provide good foundational knowledge, Forrest Brazeal and everyone using the #CloudGuruChallenge, for motivating me to develop something.
Also Bansi Mendapara, his posts make me to create more and more projects on AWS using various services.
